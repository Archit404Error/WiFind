# WiFind

WiFind is a mobile app created by Archit Mehta and Pratyush Sudhakar to help Cornell students find strong wifi connections around campus where they can go to partake in video conferences, work on assignments, etc.

The app harnesses the power of its users to collect wifi speeds from around campus and use this data to make a classification as to which locations have the best Wifi. This repository contains the frontend code for the app, built in React Native & TypeScript
